<div class="section">
  <h2>Problem:</h2>

  <p class="firstPara">Given a list <em>xs</em>, answer a large number
    of questions of the form, <strong>what is the accumulation of the elements
    whose indices are in the range [l, u]</strong>?.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Requirements:</h2>

  <p class="firstPara">Notice that we have only two requirements for
  the elements of <em>xs</em>:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>we must be able to accumulate them; and</li>
    <li>the neutral element, <em>e</em>, exists (<em>e</em> is the
        result of queries on empty intervals).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>These two suggest that the elements are <strong>Monoid</strong>s.</p>

  <p>Strictly speaking, the accumulation function need not be
    associative, but, if it is, we can build a <strong>segment
    trees</strong> from the list.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>The Naive Solution:</h2>

  <p class="firstPara">Our first solution simply <em>mconcat</em>s the
    interval's elements.</p>

{% highlight haskell %}
queryInterval :: (Monoid a) => [a] -> (Int, Int) -> a
queryInterval xs (l, u) = mconcat . take (u-l+1) . drop l $ xs
{% endhighlight %}

  <p>The <em>queryInterval</em> function requires no additional space
    and takes time proportional to the interval's size.  Therefore,
    the time necessary to query all intervals
    is <strong class="icode">O(n<sup>3</sup>)</strong>.  For large
    values of <em>n</em>, this is clearly unacceptable.  We examine a
    faster algorithm in the next section.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Simple Segment Trees:</h2>

  <p class="firstPara">A list stores <em>elements</em>; i.e. it stores
  information of the form, <strong>the value of the n<sup>th</sup>
  element is <em>something</em></strong>. A segment tree stores
  intervals; i.e. it stores information of the form, <strong>the
  accumulation of the elements with indices between <em>l</em>
  and <em>u</em> is <em>something</em></strong>.</p>

  <p>An example will clarify matters.  Here is the interval tree for
  [1..7] accumulated using addition.</p>

  <div class="imageBox">
    <img src="SegmentTree_data/sumTree17.png" alt="the sum interval tree for [1..7]" />
    <span class="caption">The interval tree for [1..7] with addition
    as accumulation</span>
  </div>

{% highlight haskell %}
-- A binary tree.
data (Monoid a) => Tree a = Branch a (Tree a) (Tree a) | Leaf a

-- A 'SegmentTree' is a binary tree and the bounds of its
-- corresponding interval.
data (Monoid a) => SegmentTree a = SegmentTree (Tree a) (Int, Int)
{% endhighlight %}

  <p>There are two types of nodes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Each <strong>leaf</strong> holds a single element.  Reading
        the leaves left to right yields the initial list;</li>
    <li>Each <strong>branch</strong> holds an interval which is the
        union of its children.  The value of a branch is the
        accumulation of the values of its children.  Each branch
        has <em>exactly</em> two children.  Combining the branches on
        a level left-to-right results in an interval which perfectly
        overlaps the initial list.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We construct a segment tree recursively by starting with the list
  and repeatedly splitting it in half.</p>

  <p>For the sake of efficiency, we only chop off the beginning of the
  list.  The list's head is always where it should be, but its end
  remains fixed.</p>

{% highlight haskell %}
-- Build the 'SegmentTree' for the given list. Time: O(n*log n)
mkTree :: (Monoid a) => [a] -> SegmentTree a
mkTree xs = SegmentTree (go xs listBounds) listBounds
    where
      listBounds = (0, length xs - 1)
      go ys (l, u)
          -- invariant: head ys == xs !! l
          | l == u    = Leaf (head ys)
          | otherwise = 
              let m      = (u-l) `div` 2
                  leftc  = go ys (l, l+m)
                  rightc = go (drop (m+1) ys) (l+m+1, u)
              in Branch (getCargo leftc `mappend` getCargo rightc) 
                        leftc rightc

getCargo (Branch x _ _) = x
getCargo (Leaf x)       = x
{% endhighlight %}

  <p>To query a tree, we start at the root and descend matching the
  nodes onto the specified interval.</p>

{% highlight haskell %}
-- Query the 'SegmentTree' for the specified closed interval. Time:
-- O(log n)
queryTree :: (Monoid a) => SegmentTree a -> (Int, Int) -> a
queryTree (SegmentTree t (s, e)) (l, u) = go t (s, e)
    where
      -- we're querying for (l, u)
      go t (s, e)
          | (l > e) || (u < s)   = mempty
          | (l <= s) && (u >= e) = getCargo t
          | otherwise = let (Branch _ leftc rightc) = t
                            m = (e-s) `div` 2
                            lv = go leftc (s, s+m)
                            rv = go rightc (s+m+1, e)
                        in lv `mappend` rv
{% endhighlight %}

  <p>During the descent, three distinct situations arise:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>if the queried interval is invalid, the result is <em>mempty</em>;</li>
    <li>if the queried interval completely overlaps the node, the
    result is the node's value; and</li>
    <li>if the queried interval is included in the current node, we
    rerun the function on its two halves and accumulate the
    results.</li>
  </ul>
